### Abstract
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of English Premier League football match data. Utilizing R and libraries, we performed data manipulation, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends within the game. We focused on team performance metrics, including goal scoring, wins distribution, and head-to-head comparisons, to derive insights into team dynamics and league standings over the years. The findings from this study are intended to assist football analysts.
